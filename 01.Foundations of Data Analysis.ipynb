    "\n",
    "At its core, **data analysis** is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to extract useful and meaningful information, support decision-making, and discover hidden patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: data analysis turns **raw facts (data)** into **stories that make sense**. Businesses, governments, and researchers rely on it to make informed decisions.\n"

    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **2. Diagnostic Analysis – “Why did it happen?”**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **3. Predictive Analysis – “What is likely to happen?”**\n",
    "\n",

    "  * Uber adjusting ride prices dynamically (surge pricing) to balance demand & supply.\n",
    "  * Airlines adjusting ticket prices depending on demand.\n",
    "  * Amazon deciding how much stock to keep in different warehouses.\n",
    "  * Healthcare systems recommending personalized treatment plans.\n",
